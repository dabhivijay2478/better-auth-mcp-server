description: Integrate Better Auth with MySQL.
----------------------------------------------

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for building web applications and other types of software. It provides a flexible and scalable database solution that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
Read more here: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have MySQL installed and configured.
Then, you can connect it straight into Better Auth.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { createPool } from "mysql2/promise";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: createPool({
    host: "localhost",
    user: "root",
    password: "password",
    database: "database",
  }),
});
```

  For more information, read Kysely's documentation to the
  [MySQLDialect](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/MysqlDialect.html).
</Callout>

## Schema generation & migration

The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Auth configuration and plugins.

<table>
  <tr className="border-b">
    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">MySQL Schema Generation</p>
    </th>

    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">MySQL Schema Migration</p>
    </th>
  </tr>

  <tr className="h-10">
    <td>✅ Supported</td>
    <td>✅ Supported</td>
  </tr>
</table>

```bash title="Schema Generation"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

```bash title="Schema Migration"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

## Additional Information

MySQL is supported under the hood via the [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) adapter, any database supported by Kysely would also be supported. (<Link href="/docs/adapters/other-relational-databases">Read more here</Link>)

# adapters: Drizzle ORM Adapter
URL: /docs/adapters/drizzle
Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/better-auth/better-auth/refs/heads/main/docs/content/docs/adapters/drizzle.mdx

Integrate Better Auth with Drizzle ORM.
        
***

title: Drizzle ORM Adapter
description: Integrate Better Auth with Drizzle ORM.
----------------------------------------------------

Drizzle ORM is a powerful and flexible ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. It provides a simple and intuitive API for working with databases, and supports a wide range of databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
Read more here: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have Drizzle installed and configured.
Then, you can use the Drizzle adapter to connect to your database.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { db } from "./database.ts";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    // [!code highlight]
    provider: "sqlite", // or "pg" or "mysql" // [!code highlight]
  }), // [!code highlight]
  //... the rest of your config
});
```

## Schema generation & migration

The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Auth configuration and plugins.

To generate the schema required by Better Auth, run the following command:

```bash title="Schema Generation"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

To generate and apply the migration, run the following commands:

```bash title="Schema Migration"
npx drizzle-kit generate # generate the migration file
npx drizzle-kit migrate # apply the migration
```

## Additional Information

The Drizzle adapter expects the schema you define to match the table names. For example, if your Drizzle schema maps the `user` table to `users`, you need to manually pass the schema and map it to the user table.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { db } from "./drizzle";
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { schema } from "./schema";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    provider: "sqlite", // or "pg" or "mysql"
    schema: {
      ...schema,
      user: schema.users,
    },
  }),
});
```

If all your tables are using plural form, you can just pass the `usePlural` option:

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    ...
    usePlural: true,
  }),
});
```

description: Integrate Better Auth with Prisma.
-----------------------------------------------

Prisma ORM is an open-source database toolkit that simplifies database access and management in applications by providing a type-safe query builder and an intuitive data modeling interface.
Read more [here](https://www.prisma.io/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have Prisma installed and configured.
Then, you can use the Prisma adapter to connect to your database.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { prismaAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/prisma";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: prismaAdapter(prisma, {
    provider: "sqlite",
  }),
});
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you have configured a custom output directory in your `schema.prisma` file (e.g., `output = "../src/generated/prisma"`), make sure to import the Prisma client from that location instead of `@prisma/client`. Learn more about custom output directories in the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/nextjs#21-install-prisma-orm-and-create-your-first-models).
</Callout>

## Schema generation & migration

The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Auth configuration and plugins.

<table>
  <tr className="border-b">
    <th>
      <p className="font-bold text-[16px] mb-1">Prisma Schema Generation</p>

title: MongoDB Adapter
description: Integrate Better Auth with MongoDB.
------------------------------------------------

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is widely used for building scalable and flexible applications. It provides a flexible schema that allows for easy data modeling and querying.
Read more here: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and configured.
Then, you can use the mongodb adapter.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";
import { mongodbAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/mongodb";

const client = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/database");
const db = client.db();

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: mongodbAdapter(db),
});
```

## Schema generation & migration

For MongoDB, we don't need to generate or migrate the schema.
